# BPC-Pulse

BPC-Pulse is a simple application built with Expo and React Native. It allows athletes to quickly record their morning health metrics so they can monitor trends over time.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run the app in development mode with Expo:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Purpose of Morning Entry

On the home screen, athletes enter their resting heart rate, how well they slept, and how they feel when they wake up. These values are stored on the device so you can review your data even when offline.

- **Expo** – framework for running the app
- **Expo Router** – file based routing
- **React Native** – UI components
- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage** – local data persistence
- **expo-haptics** and **@expo/vector-icons** – enhance the user interface

## Linting and Testing
